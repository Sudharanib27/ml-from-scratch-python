PyMLModels is a Python project focused on implementing machine learning models from scratch. The project includes custom implementations of Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), QDA (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis), and Naive Bayes algorithms. Each model is implemented without relying on external libraries, providing a deep understanding of the underlying mathematical principles. The project aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for learning and experimenting with various machine learning techniques.
